This is the first GitHub upload for any assignment I've done so far. 
There are probably many errors and many things I could have done better.
For example I didn't save the project many times and instead did it in one go.

This was a nice way to try to memorize css/html-stuff that I have already learned and forgotten once.
All in all this project was very nice for learning the basics of Git/GitHub.com
